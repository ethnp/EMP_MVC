EMP_MVC
=======

A PHP MVC Framework

This framework utilizes the following Open Source frameworks:

PHP:
ReadBeanPHP for database
PHPMailer for emails

JS:<br>
jQuery
Twitter Bootstrap JS
PHPJS
KnockOut.js
prettify.js (google)
googlecharts
stickey-headers

CSS:
Twitter Bootstrap
Google Css
HTML5shim (for ie compatibility with HTML5)

The way you access a site is similiar to CodeIgniter. The url system. But thats all thats similiar to CI.

Feel free to contribute to making this a really kick ass framework, and fork as you like.

Will add documentation and example when I get a chance...
